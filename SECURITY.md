## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority for GAO. If you find a vulnerability, please report it via email to security@gao-framework.dev rather than opening a public issue.

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Any potential impact.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a timeline for fixes.
